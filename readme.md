This is my final project for Web Development 1. For this project, I chose to create an example website that contains resources for librarians to use when planning storytime programs for preschoolers. My ultimate plan for this site would be to compile/link to the large amounts of storytime content that librarians have already published, so that there was one easily accessible source of ideas for planning programs. For the purposes of this course, though, I have kept it pretty simple - I have created several pages that display ideas for six different storytime themes. To save time for myself, and also to have some fun, I asked ChatGPT to create booklists with fake titles and authors, had it write its own rhymes and songs, and had it come up with some early literacy tips for librarians to share with parents. 

For my required features, I went with:
    1. Create a responsive menu with CSS - for phones and tablets, a hamburger menu is displayed; for desktop, links appear in the navigation bar
    2. Create accordion boxes to display different types of information - smaller screens will display the main content on the landing page in accordion boxes
    3. Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover - the accordion boxes change color on hover
    4. Bonus (in case): Run PageSpeed Insights from Google and get a score of 60 or better - the page got a 65 on desktop and 64 on mobile. https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-jennyplummer-github-io-storytimeresource/du8945547b?form_factor=desktop
In the future, I hope to more fully develop the content of the site and add additional features, like a search function.
